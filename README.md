// college homework

Program that helps in the construction of a water reservoir. 
This program can be used by consumers to control water flow and consumption. 
The program request the dimensions of a reservoir (height, width, and length, in centimeters), 
and the average daily consumption of water by consumers (in liters/day). 

Assume that the water reservoir is full and has a cubic shape. It shows:
1. The total capacity of the reservoir in liters;
2. The autonomy of the reservoir in days;
3. The classification of consumption according to the number of autonomy days: 
--High consumption if autonomy is less than 2 days; 
--Moderate consumption if autonomy is between 2 and 7 days; 
--Reduced consumption if autonomy is greater than 7 days.
